## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clinically-au/laravel-companion-demo.git
cd laravel-companion-demo
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
touch database/database.sqlite
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
npm install && npm run build
```

### Laravel 13 Note

The companion package depends on `mateffy/laravel-introspect` which doesn't yet officially support Laravel 13. This demo uses a [fork](https://github.com/clinically-au/laravel-introspect) with the `illuminate/contracts` constraint relaxed to include `^13.0`, referenced as a VCS repository in `composer.json`. This is handled automatically by `composer install` — no manual steps needed.

On **Laravel 11 or 12**, this fork is not needed — remove the `repositories` block and `mateffy/laravel-introspect` line from `composer.json`.

## Running Tests

```bash
php artisan test
```

Or just the companion tests:

```bash
php artisan test --filter=Companion
```
